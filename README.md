# tab-scraper
Script for grabbing images from open tabs for those who have to gather photo reference. For now it just works with microsoft edge but could be extended to other browsers if requested. After starting the python script click on a browser with a bunch of tabs open and it will run through each tab. If the tab has a url extension like .jpg or .png it will write that to disk and continue looping until all open tabs have been saved in which it will stop the script.

The script works by continually checking if an edge window is active and if it is the commands will either activate or deactivate
