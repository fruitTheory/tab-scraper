# tab-scraper
Script for grabbing images from open tabs for those who have to gather photo reference. For now it just works with microsoft edge but could be extended to other browsers if requested. After starting the python script click on a browser with a bunch of tabs open and it will run through each tab and write an image to disk. After all images have been saved to disk it will end the script.
